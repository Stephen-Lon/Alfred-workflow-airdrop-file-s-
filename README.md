# Alfred-workflow-airdrop-file-s-
A simple Alfred workflow combined with a macOS Shortcut to AirDrop one or more files
# Usage

This simple workflow works as a Universal Action on a selected file or files in Finder and triggers a macOS Shortcut called `AirDrop` which offers to transfer the file(s) via AirDrop. By design it does *not* work with a selected URL or selected text.

# Important note

The workflow requires a macOS Shortcut called `AirDrop`. The User Configuration of the workflow includes some guidance on creating that Shortcut.

You need to set up the Shortcut to ensure the workflow functions.
